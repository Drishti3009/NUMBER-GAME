# NUMBER-GAME
# ðŸŽ² Number Guessing Game (Java)  A simple Java-based Number Guessing Game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has 5 attempts to guess it. The game includes scoring, input validation, and replay options.   ## ðŸš€ Features - Random number generation (1â€“100) - Maximum of 5 attempts per round .
